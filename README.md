# Algorthms-and-data-structure

The purpose of this project is to familiarise with the python classes and data structure, as well as implementing the algorithms. 
In this project, the breath-first search, heap sort, insert sort, and dijkstra's algorithms were implemented. 
Many python classes were defined for data structures such as trees, linked lists, and graphs/networks.
